The program enables users to perform various dictionary-related tasks, such as searching for word definitions, finding words with specific characters, and identifying words that contain 'q' without being followed by 'u'. Here's an overview of its features and functionality:

Features:

Load Dictionary: The program can load a dictionary of words and their definitions from a text file, making it easy to manage and update the dictionary.

Find Word Definition: Users can search for the definition of a specific word in the loaded dictionary. The program provides the definition if the word is found; otherwise, it displays a "Word not found" message.

Find Words with Specific Characters: Users can search for words in the dictionary that contain a specific character a minimum number of times. This feature is useful for finding words with particular letter patterns.

Identify 'q' Without 'u': The program can identify and display words in the dictionary that contain the letter 'q' without being followed by the letter 'u'.
